# ELI — Evidence-Linked Inference

ELI is a framework for producing justified, auditable claims from signed artifacts.

It separates:
- cryptographic proof (what is provably unchanged and who signed it)
- from inference (what conclusions can reasonably be drawn)

ELI is designed to work with external signing and receipt systems
(e.g. HALO-RECEIPTS) rather than replacing them.

Status: early scaffold.
